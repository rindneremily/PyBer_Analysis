# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This analysis compared a few dataframes that were merged together to gain a better understanding of the relationship between drivers, their fares, and their cities. By completing this analysis, I could see specific relationships and where the differences lied. Manipulating the data with code also made the analysis much more straight forward. Without manipulation, it is difficult to see where the correlations in the data are. 
## Results
Total rides were portrayed by urban_ride_count. This line of code showed that urban cities had significantly more total rides than both rural and suburban. There were 1625 total rides for urban cities.
Total drivers were portrayed by sim_drivers_by_type. This line of code showed that urban cities had the most drivers. This correlates with the data from total rides in urban cities. The more drivers there are, the more likely there would be a high rate of rides.
Total fares were portrayed by sum_fares_by_type. This line of code showed that urban cities had the highest total amount of fares. Again, this correlates with the high level of rides and drivers in urban cities.
Average fare per ride was highest in rural cities. It's possible that this is because rural cities are less densely populated and each ride to get to a destination would be further than in a densely populated area, such as an urban city. Average fare per driver was also highest in rural cities.
Total fare by city type was highest in rural cities.
## Summary
In highly dense cities, like urban cities, cars could function similar to busses. To optimize driver time, they could stop at frequently visited locations to pick up customers rather than driver 2 extra blocks per customer to pick them up. Another idea could be to primarily employ drivers with electric cars in urban cities. Electric commuter cars would minimize reimbursement fees for drivers. Carpooling in rural cities could also work. This way, the longer distance could be attractive for customers wanting to pay less in fares. Over time, more customers would use this system and you could make mre money in the long term.
